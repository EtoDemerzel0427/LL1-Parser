# LL1-Parser
A simple LL1-Parser designed for *Compiler Principles and Technology*(BUPT, Fall 2018).

I implemented this in Python and made it a package. To run this, you should use Python3 and make sure you have installed `pandas`.

It is a pity that for this course in BUPT, the professor does not allow us to have a Python implementation. It is a little bit ridiculous and weird for me. Since it is not a programming language course, setting a programming language limitation should be strange. 

For this reason,  I cannot have this version as my homework to hand in, so I put it here. The full documentation can be found in this repo(in CHINESE-ZN), in which I describe the whole algorithm and usages.

For any confusion, please contact me via Email or put it in the issue.
